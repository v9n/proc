I like parentheticals (a lot).
"Sometimes (when I nest them (my parentheticals) too much (like this
(and this))) they get confusing."

Write a function that, given a sentence like the one above, along with
the position of an opening parenthesis, finds the corresponding closing
parenthesis.

Example: if the example string above is input with the number 10
(position of the first parenthesis), the output should be 79 (position
of the last parenthesis).
